# My-AI-Learning

This repo is a digital notebook of my AI exploration. From debugging my first neural network to fine-tuning Transformers on custom datasets, every file here carries the story of trial, error, and small wins. Code includes preprocessing pipelines, model architectures, and training scriptsâ€”all annotated to explain "why" behind each step. Hoping it might light up your learning path too.
